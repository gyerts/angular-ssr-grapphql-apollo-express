> UnhandledPromiseRejectionWarning: Error: You must await server.start() before calling server.applyMiddleware() at ApolloServer

This is a known bug with an open issue, and a merged PR to fix it. For now, you can downgrade to apollo-server-express@^2

Also, this warning not resolved in console, this warning becomes with version `^2`:
> ./node_modules/subscriptions-transport-ws/node_modules/ws/lib/buffer-util.js:105:21-42 - Warning: Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'bufferutil' in '/media/gyerts/home/Projects/solutions/angular-ssr-graphql-apollo-express/node_modules/subscriptions-transport-ws/node_modules/ws/lib'
